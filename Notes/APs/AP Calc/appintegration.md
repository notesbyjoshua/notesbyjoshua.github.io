# Unit 8: Applications of Integration

This unit turns integrals into geometry and accumulated quantities. You should be able to move flexibly between signed area, total change, volume, and other physical interpretations.

## Area between curves

If $$f(x) \ge g(x)$$ on $$[a,b]$$, then the area between the curves is

$$
\int_a^b [f(x)-g(x)]\,dx.
$$

For horizontal slicing with respect to $$y$$:

$$
\int_c^d [x_{\text{right}}(y)-x_{\text{left}}(y)]\,dy.
$$

## Accumulation and net change

If $$R(t)$$ is a rate, then

$$
\int_a^b R(t)\,dt
$$

gives net change over $$[a,b]$$.

So if $$P'(t)=R(t)$$, then

$$
P(b)-P(a)=\int_a^b R(t)\,dt.
$$

---

## Distance vs displacement

If velocity is $$v(t)$$, then:

$$
\text{displacement} = \int_a^b v(t)\,dt
$$

$$
\text{total distance} = \int_a^b \lvert v(t) \rvert\,dt
$$

Split total distance at sign changes of $$v(t)$$.

---

## Volume by cross sections

If cross-sectional area perpendicular to the axis is $$A(x)$$, then volume is

$$
V = \int_a^b A(x)\,dx.
$$

Common cross sections:

- squares,
- rectangles,
- semicircles,
- equilateral triangles.

## Disk and washer methods

Disk method:

$$
V = \pi \int_a^b [R(x)]^2\,dx
$$

Washer method:

$$
V = \pi \int_a^b \left([R(x)]^2-[r(x)]^2\right)\,dx
$$

## Volume by cylindrical shells

$$
V = 2\pi \int_a^b (\text{radius})(\text{height})\,dx.
$$

Shell method is often simpler when washers would require solving for inverse functions or splitting many pieces.

---

## Arc length

For a smooth function $$y=f(x)$$ on $$[a,b]$$:

$$
L = \int_a^b \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}\,dx.
$$

This is useful BC-level enrichment even when not emphasized heavily in every AP class.

---

## Improper integrals

An integral is improper if:

- an interval is infinite, or
- the integrand is unbounded.

Interpret through limits, for example:

$$
\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx
=
\lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx.
$$

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting to split total distance when velocity changes sign.
- Using top-minus-bottom when the curves cross inside the interval without splitting.
- Using wrong radii in washer problems.
- Mixing shell and washer formulas without matching the slice geometry.
