# Unit 4: Probability, Random Variables, and Probability Distributions

**Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that quantifies how likely an **event** is. In AP Statistics you usually interpret it as **long-run relative frequency**: repeat a random process many times, and the fraction of times the event occurs stabilizes near its probability. The rules below describe how to combine and update probabilities in a **sample space** of possible outcomes.

## Sample space and experiments

- A **random phenomenon** or **probability experiment** is a process with outcomes that vary from trial to trial in a way that cannot be predicted with certainty in advance, but whose possible outcomes are known.
- The sample space, denoted $$S$$, is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. An event is any subset of the sample space (a collection of one or more outcomes). The letter $$S$$ is standard notation; individual outcomes are often written as simple labels or ordered pairs when the experiment has multiple stages.
- A **tree diagram** lists stages of an experiment as branches. Multiply along a path to get the probability of that path when stages are suitably independent or conditional probabilities are marked on branches; add paths that represent the same event. Tree diagrams keep ordered outcomes visible and help avoid double-counting when the experiment is multistep.

## Basic rules of probability

- **Rule 1 (bounds)**: For any event $$A$$,

$$
0 \le P(A) \le 1
$$

- **Rule 2 (whole sample space)**: If each possible outcome is listed exactly once, the sum of their probabilities is $$1$$.
- **Rule 3 (impossibilility)**: An **impossible event** has probability $$0$$. A **sure event** (the entire sample space, or any event that must happen) has probability $$1$$.
- **Rule 4 (odds in favor)**: **Odds in favor** of an event $$A$$ compare the chance $$A$$ occurs to the chance it does not. With complement $$A'$$ (or $$A^C$$) for “not $$A$$,”

$$
\text{Odds in favor of } A = \frac{P(A)}{P(A')}
$$

Odds are a ratio, not a probability; you can recover probabilities from odds with a little algebra when needed.

## Events: complement, disjoint, union, intersection

- The **complement** of an event $$A$$ is the event that $$A$$ does not occur. It includes every outcome in $$S$$ that is not in $$A$$. Notation includes $$A'$$ and $$A^C$$.
- **Disjoint** events (also called **mutually exclusive** events) cannot both occur on the same trial: they share no outcomes, so $$P(A \cap B) = 0$$ when $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint.
- The **union** $$A \cup B$$ is “$$A$$ or $$B$$ or both”—at least one of the two events happens.
- The **intersection** $$A \cap B$$ is “$$A$$ and $$B$$ both” happen.
- **Conditional probability** “$$A$$ given $$B$$” restricts attention to outcomes where $$B$$ occurred. The notation is

$$
A \mid B
$$

read as “$$A$$ given $$B$$.”

Two events are **independent** if knowing whether one occurred does not change the probability of the other (formalized below).

## More probability rules

**Complement rule:**

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

**General addition rule (union):**

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

If $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint, then $$P(A \cap B) = 0$$ and the rule reduces to $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$.

**General multiplication rule (intersection):**

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)\,P(B \mid A) = P(B)\,P(A \mid B)
$$

From the multiplication rule you obtain the standard formula for conditional probability—the same rearrangement that describes **Bayes’ theorem** in tree-and-table problems:

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

provided $$P(B) > 0$$.

**Independence** (equivalent formulations for events with positive probability):

$$
P(A \mid B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B \mid A) = P(B)
$$

Equivalently, independence is often written as

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)\,P(B)
$$

If that product rule fails, the events are **dependent**.

## Random variables and probability distributions

A **random variable** assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment. Customarily we use capital letters such as $$X$$ or $$Y$$ for the variable and lowercase $$x$$ for a possible value it might take.

- A **discrete random variable** takes a **finite** or **countably infinite** set of values (counts, “number of successes,” and so on).
- A **continuous random variable** takes values in an interval (time, weight, distance). Probabilities for continuous models are assigned to intervals using density and area ideas in later work; this unit focuses on the discrete case.

## Discrete probability distributions

A **discrete probability distribution** lists every possible value $$x_i$$ of $$X$$ together with its probability $$P(x_i)$$ (or $$P(X = x_i)$$). The list may appear as a table, a formula, or a probability histogram.

Let $$X$$ take values $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$ with probabilities $$P(x_1), P(x_2), \ldots, P(x_n)$$. The pairing

$$
\{(x_1, P(x_1)), (x_2, P(x_2)), \ldots, (x_n, P(x_n))\}
$$

is a valid probability distribution if

$$
0 \le P(x_i) \le 1 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n
$$

and

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) = 1
$$

The first condition keeps each entry a legitimate probability; the second says exactly one of the listed values occurs (for a complete list of possibilities).

## Mean of a discrete random variable

The **expected value** $$E(X)$$ of a discrete random variable $$X$$ is also called its mean and denoted $$\mu_X$$ when emphasis is on the distribution. It is the probability-weighted average of the possible values:

$$
\mu = E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\, P(x_i)
$$

That number is a center of the distribution, but it need not be a value $$X$$ can actually take.

### Bonus!

Surprisingly, expected value is an additive property. The **linearity of expectation** states that:

$$
E(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) + ... + E(X_n)
$$

You can learn more in the combinatorics section of competition math(**ADD REFERENCE**)

## Variance of a discrete random variable

The **variance** $$\sigma^2$$ (or $$\operatorname{Var}(X)$$) measures spread around the mean as a probability-weighted average of squared deviations:

$$
\sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2\, P(x_i)
$$

The **standard deviation** is $$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$$, returned to the original units of $$X$$.

---

## Combinations (binomial coefficient)

A **combination** counts how many ways you can choose $$r$$ objects from $$n$$ distinct objects when order does not matter. The symbol is the **binomial coefficient** $$\binom{n}{r}$$, read “$$n$$ choose $$r$$”:

$$
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!\,(n-r)!}
$$

This expression appears in the **binomial probability model** (fixed $$n$$ independent trials, same success probability $$p$$, count successes, described in [Unit 5]({{ '/notes/ap/stats/samplingdistr/' | relative_url }})) and in many counting-based probability problems on the exam.
