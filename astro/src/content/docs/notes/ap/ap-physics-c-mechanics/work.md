## Work

**Work** measures energy transferred by a force acting through a displacement. For a constant force,

$$
W = \vec{F}\cdot \Delta \vec{r} = F\Delta r\cos\theta.
$$

Only the component of force parallel to displacement does work. A perpendicular force can change direction without changing speed, so it does no work at that instant. Due to this property, perpendicular forces like the normal force cannot exert any work.

For a variable force, use the line integral (just the integral over the path of an object) to evaluate work:

$$
W = \int_C \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}.
$$

In one dimension (which involves most AP Physics C problems) this becomes

$$
W = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} F_x(x)\, dx,
$$

the signed area under the force-position graph.

```

### The geometry of the dot product

Work is a scalar, so it has a sign but no direction. Since $$W = \vec{F}\cdot\Delta\vec{r} = F\,\Delta r\cos\theta$$, the sign of the work is set entirely by the angle $$\theta$$ between the force and the displacement:

```tikz
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta,calc,positioning,patterns,decorations.pathmorphing,angles,quotes}
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=Stealth, font=\small]
\draw[->, very thick, blue] (0,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {$\Delta x$};
\draw[->, very thick, red] (0,0) -- (2.7,1.8) node[above] {$\vec F$};
\draw[dashed, red] (2.7,1.8) -- (2.7,0);
\draw[->, very thick, red] (0,-0.25) -- (2.7,-0.25) node[midway,below] {$F\cos\theta$};
\draw (0.9,0) arc[start angle=0,end angle=34,radius=0.9] node[midway,right] {$\theta$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

- **Positive work** ($$0\le\theta<90^\circ$$): the force has a component along the motion and speeds the object up (it transfers energy *into* the object). A horizontal push on a sliding box does positive work.
- **Negative work** ($$90^\circ<\theta\le180^\circ$$): the force opposes the motion and slows the object (it removes energy). Kinetic friction on a sliding box does negative work.
- **Zero work** ($$\theta=90^\circ$$): a force perpendicular to the velocity does no work. The normal force on a block sliding along a floor, the tension on a ball in uniform circular motion, and the magnetic force on a charge all do zero work even though they are nonzero forces.

:::tip
Positive work will always speeds up the object, negative work always slows down the object, and zero work causes the speed to remain constant, even though the direction might change.
:::

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A force directed along the $$x$$-axis varies with position as follows: it is constant at $$F=20\ \text{N}$$ from $$x=0$$ to $$x=3\ \text{m}$$, then ramps linearly down to $$0\ \text{N}$$ at $$x=5\ \text{m}$$. Find the work done from $$x=0$$ to $$x=5\ \text{m}$$.

```tikz
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[axis lines=left,width=7.5cm,height=4.5cm,xmin=0,xmax=5.5,ymin=0,ymax=24,xlabel={$x\ (\text{m})$},ylabel={$F\ (\text{N})$},xtick={0,3,5},ytick={0,20}]
\addplot[fill=blue!18, draw=none] coordinates {(0,0) (0,20) (3,20) (5,0)} -- cycle;
\addplot[blue,very thick] coordinates {(0,20) (3,20) (5,0)};
\draw[dashed] (axis cs:3,0) -- (axis cs:3,20);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

The work is the area under the graph. Split it into a rectangle and a triangle:

$$
W = \underbrace{(20\ \text{N})(3\ \text{m})}_{\text{rectangle}} + \underbrace{\tfrac{1}{2}(2\ \text{m})(20\ \text{N})}_{\text{triangle}}
= 60\ \text{J} + 20\ \text{J} = 80\ \text{J}.
$$

If the force had pointed in the $$-x$$ direction over some interval, that area would count as negative. The graph method and the integral $$\int F_x\,dx$$ are the same calculation; the graph just makes the geometry visible.

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A position-dependent force $$F(x)=\alpha x^2-\beta x$$ acts along the $$x$$-axis, where $$\alpha=6.0\ \text{N/m}^2$$ and $$\beta=10\ \text{N/m}$$. Find the work it does on a particle moving from $$x_i=0.50\ \text{m}$$ to $$x_f=3.0\ \text{m}$$, and state whether the force adds or removes mechanical energy overall.

Use $$W = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x)\,dx$$:

$$
W=\int_{0.50}^{3.0}(\alpha x^2-\beta x)\,dx
=\left[\frac{\alpha x^3}{3}-\frac{\beta x^2}{2}\right]_{0.50}^{3.0}.
$$

Substitute values:

$$
W=\left[2x^3-5x^2\right]_{0.50}^{3.0}
=(54-45)-\left(0.25-1.25\right)=10\ \text{J}.
$$

Even though the force is negative over part of the interval and positive later, the net work is positive, so it adds $$10\ \text{J}$$ of kinetic energy. Whenever the force is not constant, you cannot use $$W = Fd$$; you must integrate.

</div>

## Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

Kinetic energy is defined as the energy of motion. Translational kinetic energy of a particle is defined as

$$
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
$$

An important relationship between kinetic energy and work is the Work-Energy Theorem.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Theorem (Work-Energy Theorem).** The net work done on a particle equals the change in its kinetic energy, $$W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K$$.

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Proof (Work-Energy Theorem).** Start with Newton's second law and the definition of work:

$$
W_{\text{net}} = \int \vec{F}_{\text{net}}\cdot d\vec{r}
= \int m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\cdot \vec{v}\,dt
= \int m\vec{v}\cdot d\vec{v}
= \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2.
$$

Therefore,

$$
W_{\text{net}}=\Delta K.
$$

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A block of mass $$m = 2.0\ \text{kg}$$ slides across a level floor with initial speed $$v_0 = 6.0\ \text{m/s}$$. The coefficient of kinetic friction is $$\mu_k = 0.30$$. How far does it slide before stopping? Use $$g = 9.8\ \text{m/s}^2$$.

The only horizontal force is kinetic friction, $$f_k = \mu_k F_N = \mu_k mg$$, directed opposite the motion. Over a distance $$d$$ it does negative work

$$
W_{\text{net}} = -f_k d = -\mu_k mg\, d.
$$

By the work-energy theorem, $$W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K = 0 - \tfrac{1}{2}mv_0^2$$:

$$
-\mu_k mg\, d = -\tfrac{1}{2}mv_0^2.
$$

The mass cancels, so the stopping distance does not depend on $$m$$:

$$
d = \frac{v_0^2}{2\mu_k g} = \frac{(6.0)^2}{2(0.30)(9.8)} = \frac{36}{5.88} \approx 6.1\ \text{m}.
$$

Notice that the stopping distance scales with $$v_0^2$$: doubling the speed quadruples the distance.

</div>

## Conservative Forces and Potential Energy

<div class="theorem-box">

**Definition.** A force is **conservative** if its work depends only on the initial and final positions, not on the path taken. Equivalently,

$$
\oint \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r} = 0
$$

around any closed path. The integral (known as a surface integral) represents the integral around a path, and thus represents the fact that in a closed loop the work done is $$0$$.

</div>

For a conservative force, define potential energy $$U$$ by

$$
W_{\text{cons}} = -\Delta U.
$$

In one dimension,

$$
F_x = -\frac{dU}{dx}.
$$

This comes directly from comparing a tiny amount of conservative work to a tiny change in potential energy:

$$
dW=F_x\,dx,
$$

and

$$
dW=-dU.
$$

Therefore

$$
F_x\,dx=-dU,
$$

so

$$
F_x=-\frac{dU}{dx}.
$$

In three dimensions,

$$
\vec{F} = -\nabla U.
$$

The $$\nabla$$ symbol is just an extension of a derivative to all three dimensions. Potential energy is not an absolute property; it requires a reference level, which is usually set at some point at infinity or zero. Only changes in potential energy affect mechanics.

### Gravitational Potential Energy

Near Earth's surface, where $$g$$ is approximately constant, the gravitational potential energy of an object is

$$
U_g = mgy
$$

if $$U_g = 0$$ is chosen at $$y=0$$. The change in gravitational potential energy is

$$
\Delta U_g = mg\Delta y.
$$

For universal gravitation, the usual zero point is defined at infinity, resulting in:

$$
U_g(r) = -\frac{GMm}{r}.
$$

The negative sign means a bound mass has less energy than it would have infinitely far away.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Proof (Near-Earth and Universal Gravitational Potential Energy).** Near Earth's surface, the gravitational force is approximately constant:

$$
\vec{F}_g=-mg\hat{y}.
$$

Since $$W_g=-\Delta U_g$$,

$$
\Delta U_g=-W_g=-\int_{y_i}^{y_f}(-mg)\,dy=mg(y_f-y_i).
$$

So, choosing $$U_g=0$$ at $$y=0$$,

$$
U_g=mgy.
$$

For universal gravitation,

$$
F_r=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}.
$$

Using $$F_r=-dU/dr$$,

$$
\frac{dU}{dr}=\frac{GMm}{r^2}.
$$

Integrate:

$$
U(r)=-\frac{GMm}{r}+C.
$$

Choosing $$U(\infty)=0$$ forces $$C=0$$, so

$$
U_g(r)=-\frac{GMm}{r}.
$$

</div>

The fact that we could even *define* a potential energy depends on gravity being conservative: the work it does between two points does not depend on the route taken.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Proof (gravity near Earth is path-independent).** Near Earth's surface $$\vec{F}_g = -mg\,\hat{y}$$, a constant vector. For *any* path from point $$A$$ to point $$B$$,

$$
W_g=\int_A^B \vec{F}_g\cdot d\vec{r}.
$$

Since $$\vec{F}_g=-mg\hat{y}$$ and $$d\vec{r}=dx\hat{x}+dy\hat{y}$$,

$$
W_g=\int_A^B (-mg\hat{y})\cdot(dx\hat{x}+dy\hat{y}).
$$

The $$x$$ part vanishes because $$\hat{y}\cdot\hat{x}=0$$, leaving

$$
W_g=-mg\int_{y_A}^{y_B}dy=-mg(y_B-y_A).
$$

The $$x$$-displacement drops out because $$\hat{y}\cdot\hat{x}=0$$, so only the change in height matters. A box carried straight up, or up a long ramp, or along a wiggling staircase to the same final height, all involve the same gravitational work. Around any closed loop ($$y_B = y_A$$), $$W_g = 0$$, which is the defining property of a conservative force.

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** With what speed $$v_{\text{esc}}$$ must a projectile leave a planet's surface (mass $$M$$, radius $$R$$, no air) so that it just barely reaches infinity (aka escapes the gravitational pull of the planet)? Use $$U_g(r) = -GMm/r$$.

"Just barely reaches infinity" means the projectile arrives at $$r\to\infty$$ with zero speed. With only gravity acting, mechanical energy is conserved:

$$
\tfrac{1}{2}mv_{\text{esc}}^2 + \left(-\frac{GMm}{R}\right) = \underbrace{0}_{K_\infty} + \underbrace{0}_{U_\infty}.
$$

Solving for $$v_{\text{esc}}$$,

$$
\tfrac{1}{2}mv_{\text{esc}}^2 = \frac{GMm}{R}, \qquad v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}.
$$

The mass of the projectile cancels, so escape speed is the same for a pebble or a rocket. Using $$g = GM/R^2$$ at the surface, this can be rewritten as $$v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{2gR}$$. For Earth ($$g = 9.8\ \text{m/s}^2$$, $$R = 6.37\times10^6\ \text{m}$$), $$v_{\text{esc}}\approx 1.12\times10^4\ \text{m/s}$$, about $$11.2\ \text{km/s}$$.

</div>

### Spring Potential Energy

For an ideal, massless spring, the potential energy stored in the spring is

$$
U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2,
$$

where $$x$$ is displacement from equilibrium.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Proof (Spring Potential Energy).** Hooke's law is

$$
F_s=-kx.
$$

For a conservative force,

$$
F_s=-\frac{dU_s}{dx}.
$$

Therefore

$$
-kx=-\frac{dU_s}{dx},
$$

so

$$
\frac{dU_s}{dx}=kx.
$$

Integrating gives

$$
U_s=\frac{1}{2}kx^2+C.
$$

Choosing $$U_s=0$$ at equilibrium, where $$x=0$$, makes $$C=0$$. Thus

$$
U_s=\frac{1}{2}kx^2.
$$

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A spring has stiffness $$k = 400\ \text{N/m}$$. How much work must an external agent do to stretch it from its natural length to $$x_1 = 0.10\ \text{m}$$, and then how much *additional* work to stretch it from $$x_1$$ to $$x_2 = 0.20\ \text{m}$$?

To stretch the spring slowly, the external force must balance the spring force, so $$F_{\text{ext}}(x) = +kx$$. The work done by this external force is

$$
W_{\text{ext}} = \int_{0}^{x} kx'\,dx' = \tfrac{1}{2}kx^2,
$$

which is exactly the stored potential energy. For the first stretch,

$$
W_1 = \tfrac{1}{2}(400)(0.10)^2 = 2.0\ \text{J}.
$$

To reach $$x_2 = 0.20\ \text{m}$$, the total stored energy is

$$
\tfrac{1}{2}(400)(0.20)^2 = 8.0\ \text{J},
$$

so the *additional* work is

$$
W_2 = 8.0\ \text{J} - 2.0\ \text{J} = 6.0\ \text{J}.
$$

Stretching the second $$10\ \text{cm}$$ takes three times the work of the first, because the force grows with displacement — the energy goes as $$x^2$$, not $$x$$. The spring itself does work $$-\tfrac{1}{2}kx^2$$ during stretching (opposing the motion).

</div>

## Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Defined **mechanical energy** as

$$
E_{\text{mech}} = K + U.
$$

If only conservative forces do work (e.g. no friction), mechanical energy is conserved:

$$
K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f.
$$

<div class="theorem-box">

**Proof (Conservation of Mechanical Energy).** The work-energy theorem says

$$
W_{\text{net}}=\Delta K.
$$

If only conservative forces do work,

$$
W_{\text{net}}=W_{\text{cons}}.
$$

By definition of potential energy,

$$
W_{\text{cons}}=-\Delta U.
$$

Therefore

$$
\Delta K=-\Delta U,
$$

or

$$
\Delta(K+U)=0.
$$

So

$$
K_i+U_i=K_f+U_f.
$$

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A bob on a string of length $$L = 1.5\ \text{m}$$ is released from rest at an angle $$\theta = 60^\circ$$ from vertical. Find its speed at the lowest point. Ignore air resistance.

The tension is always perpendicular to the bob's velocity, so it does no work; only gravity does work, and mechanical energy is conserved. The bob's height above the lowest point when the string makes angle $$\theta$$ is

$$
h = L - L\cos\theta = L(1-\cos\theta).
$$

Taking the lowest point as $$U = 0$$ and using $$K_i = 0$$:

$$
mgh = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \;\Rightarrow\; v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2gL(1-\cos\theta)}.
$$

Numerically, $$h = 1.5(1-\cos 60^\circ) = 1.5(1-0.5) = 0.75\ \text{m}$$, so

$$
v = \sqrt{2(9.8)(0.75)} = \sqrt{14.7} \approx 3.8\ \text{m/s}.
$$

The same $$v = \sqrt{2gh}$$ result holds for a block sliding down any *frictionless* ramp or curved track through the same height drop, regardless of the shape of the path — only the vertical drop $$h$$ matters.

</div>

If nonconservative forces such as kinetic friction, air drag, or applied pushes do work, then

$$
K_i + U_i + W_{\text{nc}} = K_f + U_f.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
W_{\text{nc}} = \Delta E_{\text{mech}}.
$$

Friction usually decreases mechanical energy and converts it into thermal energy, so $$W_f$$ is usually negative for a sliding object.

:::tip
If you forgot the sign of a non-conservative force, just think about whether the force would add energy or remove energy from the system (e.g. friction releases heat, meaning it removes energy).
:::

### Mechanical energy versus total energy

It is worth being careful about two different "totals." **Total mechanical energy** $$E_{\text{mech}} = K + U$$ counts only kinetic and potential energy, and it is *not* conserved when nonconservative forces act — friction, drag, and inelastic deformation all lessen it away. **Total energy**, however, *is* always conserved: the mechanical energy lost to friction does not vanish, it reappears as thermal energy (and a little sound). If we write

$$
\Delta E_{\text{mech}} + \Delta E_{\text{thermal}} + \cdots = 0,
$$

energy is conserved overall, with any mechanical energy lost usually being converted to heat or sound. This ensures that we don't violate the Law of Conservation of Energy.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A block of mass $$m = 3.0\ \text{kg}$$ is released from rest and slides a distance $$d = 4.0\ \text{m}$$ down a $$30^\circ$$ incline with coefficient of kinetic friction $$\mu_k = 0.20$$. Find its speed at the bottom of that slide. Use $$g = 9.8\ \text{m/s}^2$$.

Gravity (conservative) and friction (nonconservative) both do work. Use $$K_i + U_i + W_{\text{nc}} = K_f + U_f$$ with the bottom of the slide as $$U = 0$$. The block drops a height $$h = d\sin\theta$$, so $$U_i = mgd\sin\theta$$. The normal force is $$F_N = mg\cos\theta$$, so friction does work

$$
W_{\text{nc}} = -f_k d = -\mu_k mg\cos\theta\,d.
$$

With $$K_i = 0$$:

$$
mgd\sin\theta - \mu_k mg\cos\theta\,d = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2.
$$

Mass cancels, and solving for $$v$$:

$$
v = \sqrt{2gd(\sin\theta - \mu_k\cos\theta)}.
$$

Plugging in, $$\sin 30^\circ = 0.500$$ and $$\cos 30^\circ = 0.866$$:

$$
v = \sqrt{2(9.8)(4.0)\big(0.500 - 0.20(0.866)\big)} = \sqrt{78.4(0.327)} = \sqrt{25.6} \approx 5.1\ \text{m/s}.
$$

For comparison, a frictionless incline would give $$v = \sqrt{2gd\sin\theta} = \sqrt{39.2}\approx 6.3\ \text{m/s}$$; friction has carried away the difference as heat.

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A $$0.50\ \text{kg}$$ block is pressed against a spring ($$k = 800\ \text{N/m}$$) compressed by $$x = 0.12\ \text{m}$$ on a horizontal surface. After release, the block crosses a rough patch of length $$L = 1.2\ \text{m}$$ with $$\mu_k=0.25$$, then climbs a frictionless ramp that rises by height $$h=0.40\ \text{m}$$. Find whether the block reaches the top of the ramp, and if it does, find its speed there.

The spring force is conservative, so its stored energy $$U_s = \tfrac{1}{2}kx^2$$ is the initial energy. Friction is the only nonconservative force. Apply

$$
K_i + U_i + W_{\text{nc}} = K_f + U_f.
$$

Here $$K_i=0$$ and the initial spring energy is $$U_s=\tfrac12kx^2$$. Friction removes $$\mu_kmgL$$ on the rough patch, and climbing the ramp requires gravitational potential energy $$mgh$$. If the remaining energy is positive, the block reaches the top:

$$
\tfrac{1}{2}kx^2-\mu_kmgL-mgh=\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2.
$$

Compute each energy term:

$$
\tfrac{1}{2}kx^2=\tfrac{1}{2}(800)(0.12)^2=5.76\ \text{J},
$$

$$
\mu_kmgL=(0.25)(0.50)(9.8)(1.2)=1.47\ \text{J},
$$

and

$$
mgh=(0.50)(9.8)(0.40)=1.96\ \text{J}.
$$

The remaining kinetic energy is

$$
\tfrac12mv^2=5.76-1.47-1.96=2.33\ \text{J}.
$$

Since this is positive, the block reaches the top. Its speed there is

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{2(2.33)}{0.50}}=\sqrt{9.32}\approx3.1\ \text{m/s}.
$$

The clean strategy: spring energy in, friction and gravitational potential out, kinetic energy is whatever remains.

## Energy Diagrams and Equilibrium

In one-dimensional systems, a graph of $$U(x)$$ contains lots of useful information about force and an object's current state. As a reminder, $$F_x = -\frac{dU}{dx}.$$ Equilibrium occurs where 

$$
\frac{dU}{dx}=0,
$$

and at that point, the object has zero acceleration (since force is zero). The equilibrium is **stable** if $$U(x)$$ has a local minimum ($$\frac{d^2 U}{dx^2} > 0$$), **unstable** if it has a local maximum ($$\frac{d^2 U}{dx^2} < 0$$), and **neutral** if small displacements do not change $$U$$ to second order ($$\frac{d^2 U}{dx^2} = 0$$). A **metastable** (neutral) equilibrium is a local minimum that is stable for small disturbances but can escape if the total energy is high enough to cross a nearby barrier.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A particle of mass $$m = 0.20\ \text{kg}$$ moves in one dimension under the potential

$$
U(x) = 2x^2 - x^4
$$

(in joules, with $$x$$ in meters). Find the equilibrium positions and classify them, find the force at $$x = 0.5\ \text{m}$$, and if the particle has total energy $$E = 0.5\ \text{J}$$ and is at $$x=0$$, find its speed there.

**Equilibria.** Set $$dU/dx = 0$$:

$$
\frac{dU}{dx} = 4x - 4x^3 = 4x(1 - x^2) = 0 \;\Rightarrow\; x = 0,\ \pm 1.
$$

To classify, use the second derivative $$U''(x) = 4 - 12x^2$$:

- At $$x = 0$$: $$U'' = 4 > 0$$, a local minimum → **stable** equilibrium.
- At $$x = \pm 1$$: $$U'' = 4 - 12 = -8 < 0$$, local maxima → **unstable** equilibria.

**Force at $$x = 0.5$$.** The force is

$$
F_x = -\frac{dU}{dx} = -(4x - 4x^3) = -4(0.5) + 4(0.5)^3 = -2 + 0.5 = -1.5\ \text{N}.
$$

The force points toward $$-x$$, i.e. back toward the stable minimum at the origin — a restoring force, as expected near a potential well.

**Speed at $$x = 0$$.** Here $$U(0) = 0$$, so all the energy is kinetic:

$$
\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 = E - U(0) = 0.5\ \text{J} \;\Rightarrow\; v = \sqrt{\frac{2(0.5)}{0.20}} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.2\ \text{m/s}.
$$

The particle is trapped in the well as long as $$E$$ is below the barrier height $$U(\pm 1) = 2 - 1 = 1\ \text{J}$$; its turning points are where $$U(x) = E$$. With $$E = 0.5\ \text{J} < 1\ \text{J}$$, it oscillates back and forth inside the well.

## Power

**Power** is defined as the rate of energy transfer:

$$
P = \frac{dW}{dt}.
$$

For a constant force acting on an object with instantaneous velocity $$\vec{v}$$,

$$
P = \vec{F}\cdot \vec{v}.
$$

Average power over a time interval is also defined as

$$
\bar{P} = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}.
$$

Power is not a new kind of energy; it is how quickly energy is transferred or transformed.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A car of mass $$m = 1200\ \text{kg}$$ drives up a $$5.0^\circ$$ incline at a constant $$v = 25\ \text{m/s}$$. Neglecting friction and drag, what power must the engine deliver? Use $$g = 9.8\ \text{m/s}^2$$.

At constant speed there is no change in kinetic energy, so the engine's drive force must exactly balance the component of gravity along the incline:

$$
F = mg\sin\theta = (1200)(9.8)\sin 5.0^\circ = (11760)(0.0872) \approx 1.03\times 10^3\ \text{N}.
$$

Since the drive force is along the velocity, $$P = Fv$$:

$$
P = (1.03\times 10^3\ \text{N})(25\ \text{m/s}) \approx 2.6\times 10^4\ \text{W} \approx 26\ \text{kW}.
$$

Equivalently, the engine supplies gravitational potential energy at the rate $$P = mg\,v\sin\theta = mg\,v_y$$, where $$v_y = v\sin\theta$$ is the rate of gain of height. Both routes give the same answer because $$P = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}$$ counts only the force component along the motion.

## Practice

### Multiple Choice

::::problem
1. A force is always perpendicular to a particle's velocity. The force can change the particle's

(A) speed but not direction

(B) direction but not speed

(C) kinetic energy only

(D) total mechanical energy only


:::solution
The rate at which a force changes kinetic energy is power:

$$
P=\vec F\cdot\vec v.
$$

Here the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so the dot product is zero.


Since $$P=dK/dt=0$$, the kinetic energy and speed do not change. However, a perpendicular force can still bend the path by changing the direction of $$\vec v$$, like centripetal force does in circular motion. The answer is $$\boxed{\text{B}}$$.

The second-derivative test would then confirm whether that equilibrium is stable, but the question only asks for the location.

2. A block slides up a rough incline and comes momentarily to rest. Compared with its mechanical energy at launch, its mechanical energy at the top is

(A) greater

(B) smaller

(C) the same

(D) zero


:::solution
Mechanical energy changes when nonconservative forces do work. On the way up the incline, kinetic friction points opposite the motion, so its work is negative.

Using

$$
\Delta E_{\text{mech}}=W_{\text{fric}},
$$

and $$W_{\text{fric}}<0$$, the final mechanical energy must be smaller than the launch mechanical energy. The answer is $$\boxed{\text{B}}$$.

::::problem
3. A force $$F(x)=3x^2-2x$$ acts on a particle from $$x=0$$ to $$x=L$$. The work done is

(A) $$L^3-L^2$$

(B) $$3L^2-2L$$

(C) $$L^3+L^2$$

(D) $$3L^3-L^2$$


:::solution
For a position-dependent force, work is the signed area under the $$F$$ versus $$x$$ graph, not just force times distance.


Compute

$$
W=\int_0^L(3x^2-2x)\,dx
=\left[x^3-x^2\right]_0^L
=L^3-L^2.
$$

Therefore the answer is $$\boxed{\text{A}}$$.

The result can be positive or negative depending on $$L$$, which is allowed because work is signed area, not ordinary geometric area.

4. If $$U(x)=ax^4-bx^2$$ with $$a,b>0$$, the force is

(A) $$F_x=4ax^3-2bx$$

(B) $$F_x=-4ax^3+2bx$$

(C) $$F_x=ax^4-bx^2$$

(D) $$F_x=-a/x^4+b/x^2$$


:::solution
Force points in the direction that lowers potential energy, which is why there is a minus sign:

$$
F_x=-\frac{dU}{dx}.
$$

Differentiate the potential:

$$
\frac{dU}{dx}=4ax^3-2bx.
$$

Then apply the negative sign:

$$
F_x=-4ax^3+2bx.
$$

The minus sign is the common trap: the force is not the slope of the potential; it is the negative slope. So the answer is $$\boxed{\text{B}}$$.

::::problem
5. A particle moves in one dimension with potential energy $$U(x)$$. At a stable equilibrium,

(A) $$U'=0$$ and $$U''>0$$

(B) $$U'=0$$ and $$U''<0$$

(C) $$U'>0$$ and $$U''=0$$

(D) $$U<0$$ only


:::solution
Equilibrium requires zero force. Since $$F=-U'$$, that means

$$
U'=0.
$$

Stable equilibrium means that if the particle is displaced slightly, the force pushes it back toward equilibrium. On an energy graph, that is a local minimum:


A local minimum has positive curvature, so $$U''>0$$. The answer is $$\boxed{\text{A}}$$.

::::problem
6. A block starts from rest at height $$H$$ above a horizontal spring, slides on a frictionless track, and compresses the spring a distance $$x$$. If the block instead starts from height $$4H$$, the new maximum compression is

(A) $$x/2$$

(B) $$x$$

(C) $$2x$$

(D) $$4x$$


:::solution
At maximum compression, the block is momentarily at rest, so the lost gravitational potential energy has become spring potential energy.

For the original release,

$$
mgH=\frac12kx^2.
$$

If the height becomes $$4H$$, then

$$
mg(4H)=\frac12kx_{\text{new}}^2.
$$

The available energy is four times larger, so $$x_{\text{new}}^2=4x^2$$ and $$x_{\text{new}}=2x$$. The answer is $$\boxed{\text{C}}$$.

7. A spring with constant $$k$$ is cut into two equal halves. One half is used as a spring. Compared with the original spring, the energy stored for the same stretch $$x$$ is

(A) half as large

(B) the same

(C) twice as large

(D) four times as large


:::solution
Cutting a uniform spring in half makes it stiffer because the same force stretches a shorter length. Each half has spring constant $$2k$$.


For the same stretch $$x$$,

$$
U_{\text{half}}=\frac12(2k)x^2=kx^2,
$$

while the original stored

$$
U_{\text{orig}}=\frac12kx^2.
$$

Thus the half-spring stores twice as much energy. The answer is $$\boxed{\text{C}}$$.

::::problem
8. A block moves through a region where a force $$F(x)=F_0e^{-x/L}$$ acts in the direction of motion. The work done from $$x=0$$ to $$x=2L$$ is

(A) $$F_0L(1-e^{-2})$$

(B) $$2F_0L$$

(C) $$F_0L e^{-2}$$

(D) $$F_0/L$$


:::solution
The force changes with position, so work is the integral of the force over the displacement.


Compute

$$
W=\int_0^{2L}F_0e^{-x/L}\,dx.
$$

An antiderivative is $$-F_0Le^{-x/L}$$, so

$$
W=\left[-F_0Le^{-x/L}\right]_0^{2L}=F_0L(1-e^{-2}).
$$

The answer is $$\boxed{\text{A}}$$.

9. A cart of mass $$m$$ moves under constant power $$P$$ from rest, with no resistive forces. Its speed after time $$t$$ is

(A) $$Pt/m$$

(B) $$\sqrt{2Pt/m}$$

(C) $$2Pt/m$$

(D) $$\sqrt{Pt/(2m)}$$


:::solution
Power is the rate of energy transfer. If the power is constant and the cart starts from rest, then after time $$t$$ the work done is

$$
W=Pt.
$$

With no resistive forces, that work becomes kinetic energy:

$$
\frac12mv^2=Pt.
$$

Solving for speed,

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{2Pt}{m}}.
$$

The answer is $$\boxed{\text{B}}$$.

10. A satellite moves outward from radius $$r$$ to radius $$2r$$ around a planet of mass $$M$$. The work done by gravity during this motion is

(A) $$-\dfrac{GMm}{2r}$$

(B) $$-\dfrac{GMm}{r}$$

(C) $$\dfrac{GMm}{2r}$$

(D) zero, because gravity is perpendicular to orbital motion


:::solution
Gravity is conservative, so its work is the negative change in gravitational potential energy:

$$
W_g=-\Delta U.
$$

The potential is $$U=-GMm/r$$. Moving outward from $$r$$ to $$2r$$ increases the potential energy from $$-GMm/r$$ to $$-GMm/(2r)$$:

$$
\Delta U=-\frac{GMm}{2r}+\frac{GMm}{r}=\frac{GMm}{2r}.
$$

Therefore

$$
W_g=-\frac{GMm}{2r}.
$$

The answer is $$\boxed{\text{A}}$$.

11. A particle in potential $$U(x)=\dfrac{A}{x^2}-\dfrac{B}{x}$$, with $$A,B>0$$, has a stable equilibrium at

(A) $$x=A/B$$

(B) $$x=2A/B$$

(C) $$x=B/A$$

(D) $$x=\sqrt{A/B}$$


:::solution
Equilibrium occurs where the force is zero, which is the same as $$dU/dx=0$$.

Differentiate:

$$
\frac{dU}{dx}=-\frac{2A}{x^3}+\frac{B}{x^2}.
$$

Set this equal to zero and multiply by $$x^3$$:

$$
-2A+Bx=0.
$$

So

$$
x=\frac{2A}{B}.
$$

The answer is $$\boxed{\text{B}}$$.

The second-derivative test would then confirm whether that equilibrium is stable, but the question only asks for the location.

12. A projectile is launched upward from the surface of a planet of radius $$R$$ with speed $$v_{\text{esc}}/2$$. Neglect air resistance. Its maximum distance from the planet's center is

(A) $$4R/3$$

(B) $$3R/2$$

(C) $$2R$$

(D) $$4R$$


:::solution
Use total mechanical energy. The launch speed is half of escape speed, and

$$
v_{\text{esc}}^2=\frac{2GM}{R}.
$$

Thus

$$
K_i=\frac12m\left(\frac{v_{\text{esc}}}{2}\right)^2
=\frac18m\frac{2GM}{R}=\frac{GMm}{4R}.
$$

The initial total energy is

$$
E=\frac{GMm}{4R}-\frac{GMm}{R}=-\frac{3GMm}{4R}.
$$

At maximum radius, the speed is zero, so

$$
-\frac{GMm}{r_{\max}}=-\frac{3GMm}{4R}.
$$

Therefore $$r_{\max}=4R/3$$, and the answer is $$\boxed{\text{A}}$$.

1. A block of mass $$m$$ starts from rest at height $$H$$ on a frictionless curved track, then crosses a rough horizontal patch of length $$L$$ with coefficient of kinetic friction $$\mu_k$$ before compressing a spring of constant $$k$$.

   $$(A)$$ Derive the speed of the block just before the rough patch.

   $$(B)$$ Determine the speed just after the rough patch.

   $$(C)$$ Find the maximum spring compression.

   $$(D)$$ Determine the condition on $$H$$ for the block to reach the spring.


:::solution
$$(A)$$ On the curved part of the track there is no friction, so mechanical energy is conserved.

Starting from rest,

$$
mgH=\frac12mv^2.
$$

Cancel $$m$$ and solve:

$$
\boxed{v=\sqrt{2gH}}.
$$

$$(B)$$ Across the rough patch, kinetic friction does negative work. The friction force is $$f_k=\mu_kmg$$, so the work over distance $$L$$ is

$$
W_f=-\mu_kmgL.
$$

Use energy before and after the patch:

$$
\frac12mv_{\text{after}}^2=mgH-\mu_kmgL.
$$

Thus

$$
\boxed{v_{\text{after}}=\sqrt{2g(H-\mu_kL)}}.
$$

$$(C)$$ At maximum spring compression, the block is instantaneously at rest, so all remaining mechanical energy is spring potential energy:

$$
\frac12kx^2=mgH-\mu_kmgL.
$$

Solving,

$$
\boxed{x=\sqrt{\frac{2mg(H-\mu_kL)}{k}}}.
$$

$$(D)$$ The block reaches the spring only if it still has nonnegative kinetic energy after the rough patch:

$$
mgH-\mu_kmgL\ge0.
$$

Cancel $$mg$$ to get

$$
\boxed{H\ge\mu_kL}.

2. A particle of mass $$m$$ moves in the potential $$U(x)=ax^4-bx^2$$, where $$a,b>0$$

   $$(A)$$ Find all equilibrium positions.

   $$(B)$$ Classify each equilibrium as stable or unstable.

   $$(C)$$ If the particle has total energy $$E=0$$, find its turning points.

   $$(D)$$ If the particle has total energy $$E=0$$, determine where its speed is greatest and justify your answer using the energy diagram.


:::solution
$$(A)$$ Equilibrium means zero force, and $$F=-dU/dx$$. Therefore set $$dU/dx=0$$:

$$
\frac{dU}{dx}=4ax^3-2bx=2x(2ax^2-b)=0.
$$

So the equilibrium positions are

$$
\boxed{x=0,\qquad x=\pm\sqrt{\frac{b}{2a}}}.
$$

$$(B)$$ Use the curvature of the potential to classify them:

$$
U''(x)=12ax^2-2b.
$$

At $$x=0$$, $$U''=-2b<0$$, so the point is a local maximum and is unstable. At $$x=\pm\sqrt{b/(2a)}$$,

$$
U''=12a\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)-2b=4b>0,
$$

so those are local minima and are stable.


$$(C)$$ Turning points occur where $$K=0$$, so $$E=U(x)$$. For $$E=0$$,

$$
ax^4-bx^2=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
x^2(ax^2-b)=0.
$$

Thus

$$
\boxed{x=0,\qquad x=\pm\sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}}.
$$

$$(D)$$ Since $$E=K+U$$, the kinetic energy is $$K=E-U=-U$$. The speed is greatest where $$K$$ is greatest, which means where $$U$$ is smallest. From part $$(B)$$, the minima occur at

$$
\boxed{x=\pm\sqrt{\frac{b}{2a}}}.

3. A small spacecraft of mass $$m$$ moves radially away from a planet of mass $$M$$. Its engine supplies constant power $$P$$ for time $$t_0$$, starting from rest at radius $$R$$. Ignore air resistance and the changing mass of the spacecraft.

   $$(A)$$ Write an energy equation relating the spacecraft's speed and radius after the burn.

   $$(B)$$ Determine the minimum engine energy needed for escape if the burn ends at radius $$r_f$$.

   $$(C)$$ Explain whether delivering the same energy quickly or slowly changes the escape condition in this idealized model.

   $$(D)$$ Identify one assumption in the model that would fail for a real rocket.


:::solution
$$(A)$$ The engine adds energy $$Pt_0$$ during the burn. Gravity is handled through potential energy, so the total mechanical energy after the burn is the initial mechanical energy plus the engine work.

Thus

$$
\boxed{\frac12mv^2-\frac{GMm}{r}=-\frac{GMm}{R}+Pt_0}.
$$

$$(B)$$ Escape means the spacecraft can reach infinity with nonnegative kinetic energy. Since $$U(\infty)=0$$, this requires total energy $$E\ge0$$. Starting from rest at radius $$R$$, the initial energy is $$-GMm/R$$, so the minimum engine energy needed is

$$
\boxed{\frac{GMm}{R}}.
$$

If the burn ends at $$r_f$$, the same criterion is applied to the final total energy there: $$\frac12mv_f^2-GMm/r_f\ge0$$.

$$(C)$$ In this idealized model, only the total engine energy matters, not the rate at which it is delivered. Delivering the same energy quickly or slowly gives the same escape condition as long as the model assumptions remain true.

$$(D)$$ A real rocket changes mass as fuel is expelled, so treating $$m$$ as constant is a major failed assumption. Real rockets also have finite thrust direction, exhaust speed limits, drag, and inefficiencies, any of which would change the motion.
