Unit 7 is about **chemical equilibrium**: the state in a **closed system** where a reversible reaction’s **forward** and **reverse** rates are equal, so **macroscopic** concentrations (or partial pressures) stop changing even though reactants and products are still interconverting at the molecular level. You will write **equilibrium constants** ($$K_c$$, $$K_p$$), compare them to the **reaction quotient** ($$Q$$), use **ICE tables** to compute equilibrium compositions, apply **Le Châtelier’s principle** to predict disturbance responses, and extend the same ideas to **solubility** ($$K_{sp}$$), **precipitation**, and **complex-ion** formation ($$K_f$$). These tools connect directly to **thermodynamics** through **Gibbs free energy** and the **van’t Hoff equation** (how $$K$$ changes with temperature), and to later work on **acids and bases**, where $$K_a$$ and $$K_b$$ are themselves equilibrium constants.

## Chemical Equilibrium

Most reactions we have looked at previously were **irreversible reactions**, or reactions that can only go one way (forward). A **reversible reaction** can run in both directions (forward and backwards). In a **closed system** (no escape of matter), the forward reaction consumes reactants and forms products, while the reverse reaction does the opposite. **Chemical equilibrium** is reached when the **rate of the forward reaction** equals the **rate of the reverse reaction**. At that point:

- **Concentrations** (or for gases, **partial pressures**) remain **constant** over time (they are **not** necessarily equal to one another)
- The system is **dynamic**: molecules still react, but there is **no net** change in amounts. This is different from a **completed** or **irreversible** reaction, where at least one reactant is effectively exhausted and the process does not establish a lasting balance between forward and reverse paths at ordinary conditions.

The approach to equilibrium has a characteristic shape: starting from pure reactants, the **forward rate** is high (reactant concentrations are large) and the **reverse rate** is zero. As products build up, the forward rate falls and the reverse rate rises until the two are **equal**—from that moment on, concentrations level off and stay flat. Crucially, "equal rates" does *not* mean "equal concentrations"; the leveled-off amounts can be lopsided in either direction depending on $$K$$.

**Homogeneous** equilibrium means all reacting species are in the same phase (e.g. all gases, or all in one solution). **Heterogeneous** equilibrium includes **pure solids** or **pure liquids** as separate phases; their activities are taken as constant and they are **omitted** from the equilibrium expression (see below).

---

## Equilibrium constant $$K_c$$

For a balanced reaction in solution (molar concentrations in $$\text{mol/L}$$),

$$
j\text{A} + k\text{B} \rightleftharpoons l\text{C} + m\text{D},
$$

the **equilibrium constant** in terms of concentration is

$$
K_c = \frac{[\text{C}]^l [\text{D}]^m}{[\text{A}]^j [\text{B}]^k},
$$

where each $$[]$$ is the equilibrium molarity raised to the power of the **stoichiometric coefficient**. Only **aqueous** solutes or gases appear in $$K_c$$, since the concentrations of pure solids/liquids do not change, and therefore are always assumed to be 1. In addition, $$K_c$$ will not change unless temperature changes, so $$K_c$$ is only **temperature-dependent**.

On the AP exam, $$K$$ is treated as a dimensionless ratio by implicitly comparing each concentration to a **standard reference** (standard state). Regardless, you should still use the same algebraic form when you set up problems.

### Extreme $$K_c$$ value rules

**Orders of magnitude** help you judge extent (at a given temperature):

- If $$K_c$$ is very large (e.g. $$K_c \gg 1$$, sometimes textbook thresholds like $$K_c > 10^{10}$$), the **forward** reaction is **product-favored** at equilibrium—substantial conversion to products. This usually means that the forward reaction is approximately an **irreversible** reaction
- If $$K_c$$ is very small (e.g. $$K_c \ll 1$$, sometimes $$K_c < 10^{-10}$$), the mixture stays **reactant-heavy**, meaning that the reaction basically did not start at all.

These cutoffs are rules of thumb; what matters is comparing $$Q$$ to $$K$$ and interpreting $$K$$ relative to $$1$$.

### Manipulating $$K$$ for related equations

- **Reverse reaction:**
  $$
  K_{c,\text{reverse}} = \frac{1}{K_{c,\text{forward}}}.
  $$
- **Multiply the whole equation by an integer $$n$$:**
  $$
  K_c' = (K_c)^n
  $$
- **Add sequential steps** (all at the same temperature): the overall $$K$$ is the **product** of the step constants:
  $$
  K_{\text{overall}} = K_1 \times K_2 \times \cdots
  $$

---

## Equilibrium in the gas phase: $$K_p$$

For gas-phase equilibria it is often convenient to use **partial pressures** (in atmospheres on the AP exam, unless stated otherwise). For

$$
j\text{A}(g) + k\text{B}(g) \rightleftharpoons l\text{C}(g) + m\text{D}(g),
$$

define

$$
K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{C}})^l (P_{\text{D}})^m}{(P_{\text{A}})^j (P_{\text{B}})^k}.
$$

Only gaseous species appear (since aqueous solutions and pure solids/liquids do not have partial pressures). From the ideal gas law, $$P = (\text{n/V})RT = MRT$$ for a gas (M = molarity). The standard relationship is

$$
K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n_{\text{gas}}},
$$

where $$\Delta n_{\text{gas}}$$ is difference between the amount of moles of products and reactants (from the balanced equation), and $$R$$ must be **consistent** with the pressure units used (e.g. $$R = 0.0821\ \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}$$ when $$P$$ is in atm).

---

## Reaction quotient $$Q$$

The **reaction quotient** has the **same algebraic form** as $$K$$, but it uses concentrations or pressures at any instant, not necessarily at equilibrium.

For concentrations:

$$
Q_c = \frac{[\text{C}]^l [\text{D}]^m}{[\text{A}]^j [\text{B}]^k}.
$$

### Interpreting $$Q_c$$ vs $$K_c$$

- If $$Q < K$$, the ratio of products to reactants is **too small** for equilibrium; the system shifts **right** (toward products).
- If $$Q > K$$, the ratio is **too large**; the system shifts **left** (toward reactants).
- If $$Q = K$$, the system is **at equilibrium**.

A useful trick is to line up $$K$$ and $$Q$$ alphabetically (so $$K$$ on the left and $$Q$$ on the right), and whatever direction the sign goes (e.g. < (less than) goes left) is the direction the reaction goes.

The same logic applies to $$Q_p$$ and $$K_p$$ for gases.

\end{tikzpicture}
```


A **catalyst** speeds both forward and reverse rates equally, so it **does not change** $$K$$ or the equilibrium position - it only shortens the time needed to reach equilibrium.

---

## Gibbs free energy and equilibrium

The link between standard Gibbs free energy change and the equilibrium constant (same temperature) is

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K,
$$

where $$K$$ is $$K_c$$ or $$K_p$$ according to how the reaction is expressed, and *must match* the standard-state convention your course uses. For many AP problems, $$K$$ is $$K_c$$ for solution chemistry and $$K_p$$ when all species are gases and the expression is written in pressures. The Gibbs free energy value determines if a reaction is spontaneous, which is talked about more in [Unit 9](/notes/ap/chem/thermoelectro/).

Qualitative connections (at standard conditions, using $$K$$ relative to $$1$$):

- If $$K > 1$$, then $$\Delta G^\circ < 0$$: the forward reaction is **thermodynamically favorable (spontaneous)** under standard conditions.
- If $$K < 1$$, then $$\Delta G^\circ > 0$$: the reverse direction is favored under standard conditions and the forward reaction is **not spontaneous**.
- If $$K = 1$$, then $$\Delta G^\circ = 0$$, meaning the reaction is **at equilibrium**.

For *nonstandard* conditions, the reaction quotient enters:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT \ln Q.
$$

At equilibrium, $$Q = K$$ and $$\Delta G = 0$$, which recovers $$\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K$$. Here $$R$$ is the gas constant ($$8.314\ \text{J/(mol·K)}$$ when using joules), and $$T$$ is kelvin.

### The van’t Hoff equation

Le Châtelier’s principle says that $$K$$ changes with *temperature* only, and the **van’t Hoff equation** makes that dependence quantitative. It follows from the way $$\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K$$ combines with $$\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ$$ when you ask how $$K$$ must move if $$T$$ changes (treating $$\Delta H^\circ$$ and $$\Delta S^\circ$$ as *approximately constant* over a modest temperature range: a standard AP assumption unless a problem says otherwise).

If $$K_1$$ and $$K_2$$ are equilibrium constants (*same* kind: both $$K_c$$ or both $$K_p$$, matching how the reaction is written) at absolute temperatures $$T_1$$ and $$T_2$$, then

$$
\ln\frac{K_2}{K_1} = -\frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_2}-\frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_1}-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
$$

Here $$\Delta H^\circ$$ is the *standard enthalpy change* for the reaction as written (see [Unit 6: Thermochemistry](/notes/ap/chem/thermochemistry/)). Use $$R = 8.314\ \text{J/(mol·K)}$$ when $$\Delta H^\circ$$ is in **joules per mole** of reaction as written.

**Sign check:** if the forward reaction is *endothermic* ($$\Delta H^\circ > 0$$) and $$T_2 > T_1$$, then $$K_2 > K_1$$—warming *increases* $$K$$, matching the picture that heat acts like a *reactant* in an endothermic forward process. If the forward reaction is *exothermic* ($$\Delta H^\circ < 0$$), raising $$T$$ *decreases* $$K$$.

The **differential** form (useful conceptually and in derivations) is

$$
\frac{d\ln K}{dT} = \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{RT^2},
$$

which shows that sensitivity of $$\ln K$$ to temperature is *larger* when $$\Delta H^\circ$$ is large and when $$T$$ is *low* (through the $$1/T^2$$ factor in how small $$\Delta T$$ steps accumulate).

---

## Le Châtelier’s principle

**Le Châtelier’s principle** is a qualitative rule: if a **stress** disturbs an equilibrium, the system shifts in the direction that **partially counteracts** the stress (new equilibrium is established; $$K$$ is unchanged unless **temperature** changes).

Typical stresses:

- **Concentration:** Adding a **reactant** shifts toward **products**; removing a product does the same. Adding **product** shifts toward **reactants**.
- **Pressure (gases):** Reducing volume increases total pressure; the system shifts toward the side with **fewer moles of gas** (if any). Adding an **inert gas** at **constant volume** does **not** change partial pressures of reactants/products—**no** shift. At **constant pressure**, adding inert gas increases volume and can shift the equilibrium; AP questions usually emphasize the constant-volume case.
- **Temperature:** $$K$$ **changes** with temperature. Treat **heat** as part of the reaction: for an **endothermic** forward reaction ($$\Delta H > 0$$), **raising** $$T$$ favors the **forward** direction (larger $$K$$ if the forward reaction is endothermic). For an **exothermic** forward reaction ($$\Delta H < 0$$), **raising** $$T$$ favors the **reverse** direction (smaller $$K$$). **Cooling** favors the exothermic direction.

Since $$K$$ depends on $$T$$, **do not** treat temperature like a simple concentration stress when you need a **numerical** $$K$$: use the correct $$K$$ for the new temperature if given, compute $$K_2$$ from $$K_1$$ with the **van’t Hoff equation** (previous section), or reason qualitatively from $$\Delta H$$.

## ICE tables

**ICE** stands for **Initial**, **Change**, **Equilibrium**. You use a table to organize amounts (or concentrations) for one reversible process.

**Setup:**

1. Write a **balanced** equation.
2. **Initial** row: given starting concentrations (after any mixing).
3. **Change** row: express unknown change as $$x$$ (or a multiple like $$2x$$ from stoichiometry): reactants **lose** ($$-jx$$, etc.) and products **gain** ($$+lx$$, etc.), although you could swap the signs and have the same result. Note that if one side is 0, it can't lose any concentration, so it must have a positive change!
4. **Equilibrium** row: Initial + Change.

**Rules and tips:**

- Omit **pure solids** and **pure liquids** from the table if they do not define the solution volume.
- If a reactant is **limiting**, one species may be **consumed completely** before equilibrium in a sequential sense; still check whether the reaction can **proceed in reverse** from that state (ICE applies to the equilibrium stage you model).
- **Small $$K$$** (product-poor): equilibrium lies left; $$x$$ may be negligible compared to initial concentrations—**verify** with the **5% rule** (or exact quadratic) when your course allows.
- **Large $$K$$:** equilibrium lies right; sometimes you assume **complete** reaction first, then **back-react** a small amount.

### The small-$$x$$ approximation and the 5% rule

When $$K$$ is small, very little reactant converts, so a term like $$0.500-x$$ in the denominator is barely changed by $$x$$. Approximating $$0.500-x\approx0.500$$ turns an otherwise-quadratic (or worse) equation into one you can solve by simple algebra. The approximation is considered valid when

$$
\frac{x}{[\text{A}]_0}\times100\% \le 5\%,
$$

i.e. $$x$$ is at most $$5\%$$ of the initial concentration it was subtracted from. If the computed $$x$$ fails this test, the approximation is too rough—go back and solve the **quadratic** exactly (or iterate). As a rough guide, the approximation is usually safe when $$[\text{A}]_0/K \gtrsim 400$$.


| Step | Reactants | Products |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial | starting concentrations | starting concentrations |
| Change | subtract according to stoichiometry | add according to stoichiometry |
| Equilibrium | initial plus change | initial plus change |

For $$aA+bB\rightleftharpoons cC+dD$$, changes usually look like $$-ax$$, $$-bx$$, $$+cx$$, and $$+dx$$.

## Solubility equilibrium and $$K_{sp}$$

You might remember the solubility rules from Unit 4. For a **sparingly soluble** ionic solid (basically anything that is considered "insoluble" to water), dissolution is an equilibrium. For example,

$$
\text{A}_m\text{B}_l(s) \rightleftharpoons m\,\text{A}^{a+}(aq) + l\,\text{B}^{b-}(aq).
$$

The **solubility product** is

$$
K_{sp} = [\text{A}^{a+}]^m [\text{B}^{b-}]^l.
$$

The solid (precipitate) does **not** appear in $$K_{sp}$$. This is equivalent to $$K_c$$ but for a dissolution.

### Setting up ICE tables for $$K_{sp}$$

Setting up an ICE table for $$K_{sp}$$ is slightly different from a normal ICE table procedure.

**Setup:**

1. Write a **balanced** equation for solubility (remember that the solid is ALWAYS on the left side).
2. **Initial** row: given starting concentrations (after any mixing). For the concentration of the solid, just write "solid" in that box.
3. **Change** row: This is the same as a regular ICE table.
4. **Equilibrium** row: This is the same as a regular ICE table, except write "solid" for initial for the precipitate.

### Molar solubility

**Molar solubility** ($$s$$) is the number of **moles of solid** that dissolve per liter of solution to reach saturation (under stated conditions). If one formula unit of $$\text{A}_m\text{B}_l$$ produces $$m$$ ions of $$\text{A}$$ and $$l$$ ions of $$\text{B}$$, then at saturation

$$
[\text{A}^{a+}] = ms, \qquad [\text{B}^{b-}] = ls,
$$

and

$$
K_{sp} = (ms)^m (ls)^l = m^m\, l^l\, s^{m+l}.
$$

Solve for $$s$$ given $$K_{sp}$$, or $$K_{sp}$$ given $$s$$. In an ICE table, the molar solubility is equivalent to the $$x$$ value.

### Ion product and precipitation

The **ion product** $$Q_{sp}$$ uses **current** ion concentrations in the $$K_{sp}$$ expression (same form as $$K_{sp}$$).

- If $$Q_{sp} < K_{sp}$$, the solution is *unsaturated*; more solid can dissolve.
- If $$Q_{sp} = K_{sp}$$, the solution is *saturated* (at equilibrium with solid, if present).
- If $$Q_{sp} > K_{sp}$$, *precipitation* occurs until $$Q_{sp}$$ drops to $$K_{sp}$$ (assuming equilibrium can be reached).

### Common-ion effect

If one of the ions is already present from another source (**common ion**), its higher initial concentration shifts dissolution **left**, **lowering** molar solubility compared to pure water. ICE-style reasoning applies: treat initial $$[\text{A}^{a+}]$$ or $$[\text{B}^{b-}]$$ as nonzero before the solid dissolves further.

### Selective precipitation

**Selective precipitation** separates ions by adding a reagent that forms salts with **very different** $$K_{sp}$$ values. The ion whose $$Q_{sp}$$ exceeds its $$K_{sp}$$ **first** (lowest $$K_{sp}$$ or favorable stoichiometry) precipitates preferentially as concentration is raised—used analytically and conceptually on the exam.

---

## Complex ions and formation constants

A **complex ion** consists of a **central metal cation** (Lewis acid) bound to **ligands** (Lewis bases) that donate electron pairs (learn more about acids/bases in [Unit 8](/notes/ap/chem/acidbase/)). In a solution, stepwise binding equilibria exist; textbooks often emphasize an overall **formation** (stability) constant $$K_f$$ for

$$
\text{M}^{n+} + x\,\text{L} \rightleftharpoons \text{ML}_x^{n+},
$$

with

$$
K_f = \frac{[\text{ML}_x^{n+}]}{[\text{M}^{n+}][\text{L}]^x},
$$

matching the form of $$K_c$$ for that net reaction (charges and stoichiometry depend on the specific complex). A **larger** $$K_f$$ means the complex is **more stable** (more product-favored at equilibrium). If ligand is in large excess and $$K_f$$ is large, it is often reasonable to assume **complete** formation for stoichiometry purposes—check problem assumptions.

The **dissociation** constant $$K_d$$ for breaking the complex apart is the **reciprocal** of $$K_f$$ for the same net forward/back pairing:

$$
K_f = \frac{1}{K_d}.
$$

**Coordination number** is the number of donor atoms bound to the metal; common geometries include **linear** (2), **tetrahedral** or **square planar** (4), and **octahedral** (6).

---

:::checklist

1. **Balance** the equation and identify **phase** of each species.
2. Write $$K_c$$, $$K_p$$, or $$K_{sp}$$ **omitting pure solids/liquids** (and solvent water in dilute aqueous $$K_c$$ unless specified).
3. Compute **$$Q$$** if asked whether the system shifts; compare to $$K$$.
4. Use **ICE** for unknown equilibrium concentrations; watch **stoichiometric** multiples of $$x$$.
5. Remember *temperature* changes $$K$$; *catalyst* does not. For two temperatures, relate $$K_1$$ and $$K_2$$ with the **van’t Hoff equation** if $$\Delta H^\circ$$ is known (or given).
6. For solubility, track **common ions**, **$$Q_{sp}$$ vs $$K_{sp}$$**, and **complex formation**, which can *increase* solubility by tying up a metal ion (e.g. $$\text{AgCl}$$ dissolving more in ammonia).

:::

The same equilibrium-constant methods apply to **acid–base** ($$K_a$$, $$K_b$$, $$K_w$$) and **buffers** in the next unit—only the chemical reaction and symbols change.

### FRQ

::::frq{id=chem-equilibrium-1}
7. At a certain temperature, $$K_c=4.00$$ for

$$
\text{A}(g)\rightleftharpoons2\text{B}(g).
$$

A sealed container initially has $$0.600\ M$$ $$\text{A}$$ and no $$\text{B}$$.

   $$(A)$$ Write the equilibrium-constant expression.

   $$(B)$$ Set up an ICE table using $$x$$ for the amount of $$\text{A}$$ consumed.

   $$(C)$$ Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of $$\text{A}$$ and $$\text{B}$$.

:::solution
$$(A)$$

$$
K_c=\frac{[\text{B}]^2}{[\text{A}]}.
$$

The coefficient $$2$$ in front of $$\text{B}$$ becomes the exponent $$2$$ in the equilibrium expression. There are no solids or liquids to omit in this reaction.

$$(B)$$ The ICE setup is

|        | $$\text{A}$$ | $$\text{B}$$ |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Initial | $$0.600$$ | $$0$$ |
| Change | $$-x$$ | $$+2x$$ |
| Equilibrium | $$0.600-x$$ | $$2x$$ |

The $$+2x$$ appears because every mole of $$\text{A}$$ that reacts produces $$2$$ moles of $$\text{B}$$.

$$(C)$$ Substitute into $$K_c$$:

$$
4.00=\frac{(2x)^2}{0.600-x}.
$$

So

$$
4.00=\frac{4x^2}{0.600-x}
$$

and

$$
x^2=0.600-x.
$$

Thus

$$
x^2+x-0.600=0.
$$

The positive root is $$x=0.421$$. Therefore,

$$
[\text{A}]_{\text{eq}}=0.600-0.421=0.179\ M
$$

and

$$
[\text{B}]_{\text{eq}}=2(0.421)=0.842\ M.
$$

The negative root is rejected because it would make no physical sense for the reaction progress variable in this setup. Both equilibrium concentrations are positive, which is a useful check.

8. The 2024 AP Chemistry exam included an equilibrium particle-diagram question for $$\text{H}_2(g)+\text{I}_2(g)\rightleftharpoons2\text{HI}(g)$$. (Adapted from College Board, [2024 AP Chemistry FRQ 5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap24-frq-chemistry.pdf).)

   $$(A)$$ Write the expression for $$Q$$.

   $$(B)$$ If $$[\text{H}_2]=0.20\ M$$, $$[\text{I}_2]=0.10\ M$$, and $$[\text{HI}]=0.30\ M$$, calculate $$Q$$.

   $$(C)$$ If $$K=50$$, predict the direction the system shifts.

:::solution
$$(A)$$

$$
Q=\frac{[\text{HI}]^2}{[\text{H}_2][\text{I}_2]}.
$$

The coefficient $$2$$ on $$\text{HI}$$ becomes the exponent $$2$$.

$$(B)$$

$$
Q=\frac{(0.30)^2}{(0.20)(0.10)}=\frac{0.090}{0.020}=4.5.
$$

$$(C)$$ Since $$Q<K$$, the system has too little product relative to equilibrium. It shifts toward products, forming more $$\text{HI}$$ and consuming $$\text{H}_2$$ and $$\text{I}_2$$. The value of $$K$$ does not change during the shift because temperature is not changed.
